    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p><em>Chicken tikka masala made easy with this great-tasting recipe — simply marinate chicken breast
            in yogurt and spices and then simmer in a tomato cream sauce. Serve with rice or warm pita bread.</em></p>

    <p>I have really high standards when it comes to my favourites. And Butter Chicken tops the list. So it annoys me
        when butter chicken is too sweet or too oily or just doesn't have a punch of flavour that makes you want to dive
        into the sauce.
    </p>
    <p>For a lot of people, making butter chicken at home might translate into long hours spent in the kitchen. That's
        not true at all. This recipe takes a little under an hour from start to finish, and we are not using a ton of
        butter or cream to give it that luxurious, creamy taste either. How? I'm going to show you.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup yogurt</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
        <li>4 teaspoons ground cumin, divided</li>
        <li>3 boneless skinless chicken breasts, cut into bite-size pieces</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons salt, divided, or more to taste</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons paprika</li>
        <li>¼ cup chopped fresh cilantro</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps to prepare</h3>
    <ol>
        <li> Combine yogurt, lemon juice, 2 teaspoons cumin, cinnamon, cayenne, black pepper, ginger, and 1 teaspoon
            salt in
            a large bowl.

            remaining 2 teaspoons cumin, paprika, and remaining 1 teaspoon salt. Stir in tomato sauce and cream. Simmer
            on low heat until sauce thickens, about 20 minutes. </li>
